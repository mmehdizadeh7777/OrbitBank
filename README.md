Orbit Bank is one of the leading banking and financial service providers
and is facing challenges in managing their monolithic applications and
experiencing downtime during deployment. The company needs to
develop an online banking application that provides private banks with a
global accounting foundation, offering electronic banking services to all
private banks, and enable private bank clients to carry out their daily
transactions.
To address these issues, the company has decided to transition to a
microservices architecture and implement a DevOps pipeline workflow
using Jenkins, Ansible playbook, and Kubernetes cluster to deploy
container on Docker Hub.
